# pleural-effusion
we made the classifier of the etiology for pleural effusion. 
Five kinds of the model were tested as a classifier: 
** random-forest, gradient-boost model, multinomial logistic regression model, multi-layer perceptron with cross-entropy loss and contrastive loss 

the embedding space of the contrastive-loss model shows clustered data points by each category because the contrastive loss pulls the data of the same labels.
With t-SNE and UMAP visualization, the embedding space is visualized. 

You can see the embedding space and model metrics in our uploaded files.

Detailed methods and results will be published in the medical journal soon.
